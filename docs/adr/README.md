# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR records one decision that is expensive to rediscover: what was decided,
and why the alternatives were rejected. ADRs are immutable once written — a
decision that changes gets a new ADR that supersedes, revises, or amends the
old one, and the "Supersedes / revised by" column below records those links.

New ADRs take the next unused number (`00NN-kebab-case-title.md`) regardless of
topic. Numbers are identifiers, not an ordering, so an ADR that continues an
earlier series does not need to sit next to it.

## SciVis Studio projects and datasets
